# The-Evolution-Simulator

The Evolution Simulator is a basic simulation of Darwin's Theory of evolution, where species compete for food and other resources, in a game known widely as 'natural selection' or 'survival of the fittest'. The faster/stronger/bigger/etc animal gets more food, so is generally able to live longer, and ends up having more children. So that animals faster/stronger/bigger/etc genes are passed down, while the slower/weaker/smaller/etc genes die off. Slowly over time, the average speed/strength/size/etc of the entire species increases, as do the animals in general. It's this effect which is replicated in this simulation.
