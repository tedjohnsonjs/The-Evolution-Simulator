# The-Evolution-Simulator

The Evolution Simulator is a basic simulation of Darwin's Theory of evolution, where species compete for food and other resources, in a game known widely as 'natural selection' or 'survival of the fittest'. The faster/stronger/bigger/etc animal gets more food, so is generally able to live longer, and ends up having more children. So that animals faster/stronger/bigger/etc genes are passed down, while the slower/weaker/smaller/etc genes die off. Slowly over time, the average speed/strength/size/etc of the entire species increases, as do the animals in general. It's this effect which is replicated in this simulation.

This program ustilizes the panel component in WinForms to draw its graphics. More information can be found in my blog post.
